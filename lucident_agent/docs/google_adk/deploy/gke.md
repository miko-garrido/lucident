# GKE

Deploy ADK agents to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for full control and scalability.

- Prepare your agent container image.
- Push to Google Container Registry or Artifact Registry.
- Create Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, etc.).
- Use `kubectl` to deploy to your GKE cluster.
- Expose your service as needed (LoadBalancer, Ingress).

Refer to the [official docs](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/gke/) for detailed steps and YAML examples.
